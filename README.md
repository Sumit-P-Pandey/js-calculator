# 🧮 JavaScript Calculator

A simple calculator built using **vanilla JavaScript**, focusing on logic, event handling, and DOM manipulation without any frameworks.

---

## ✨ Features

* Basic arithmetic operations: **+ , − , × , ÷**
* Button-based input handling
* Keyboard support (numbers, operators, Enter, Escape, Backspace)
* Operator precedence handling (multiplication & division first)
* Division-by-zero error handling
* Clear display functionality

---

## 🧠 How it works

* User input is collected using button clicks and keyboard events
* Numbers and operators are stored as an expression string
* The expression is parsed manually (no `eval`)
* Calculations respect operator precedence
* Results are shown instantly on the display

## 🛠 Tech Used

* HTML
* CSS
* **Vanilla JavaScript** (DOM manipulation & logic)

No libraries or frameworks were used.
